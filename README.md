In this repository you need to install fontawesome at the very beginning!!!!!
A typical TodoList, based on JS,  showing how to: capture fields, texts, and then create individual "li" - tasks from them and display warning messages. It is extended with functions enabling the edition of a given task, marking its implementation and a button for definitive deletion. By using the &lt;button> tag, it has the ability to navigate using the keyboard.
